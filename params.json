You have total freedom in modifying it to match your needs while having a solid foundation to start with.\r\n\r\n## Quick start\r\n\r\nYou'll need about **8 GB of RAM** in the default configuration. 7 virtual machines will be created. The cluster was tested on **Linux**, **Mac OS** and **Windows**.\r\n\r\n##### Dependencies\r\n\r\n1. [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)\r\n2. [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)\r\n3. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)\r\n\r\n*Virtualization needs to be enabled in BIOS. You probably have this enabled, but if things go awry, this might be the problem.*\r\n\r\n##### Installation\r\n\r\n* Open a new terminal.\r\n* Download the configuration by issuing `git clone git@github.com:cosmincatalin/hbase-cluster.git` (or `git clone https://github.com/cosmincatalin/hbase-cluster.git` if you don't have an ssh agent running).\r\n* Go into the **hbase-cluster** directory.\r\n* Issue the magical `vagrant up`\r\n* Go make yourself a tea, it can take anywhere between 15 minutes to 40 minutes, depending on your internet connection speed.\r\n* Log in the master `vagrant ssh`\r\n* Log in as the base hduser `sudo su - hduser`\r\n* Start HBase `./hbase/bin/start-hbase.sh`\r\n\r\n## The long story\r\n\r\nFor whomever wants to understand what actually goes on behind the scenes, here is an explanation of the software stack and the architecture of which the Hadoop cluster is made of.\r\n\r\n##### VirtualBox\r\n\r\nVirtualBox is a popular software package used for creating virtual machines. It is **free to use** and exposes an API for working with it. VirtualBox is the foundation of the Hadoop cluster.\r\n\r\n##### Vagrant\r\n\r\nVagrant is an utility that leverages the API of VirtualBox for the creation of virtual machines. Vagrant can be plugged in with different *provisioners* that configure the virtual machines.\r\n\r\n##### Puppet\r\n\r\nEnter Puppet, which is currently the de-facto industry standard for system configuration automation. Vagrant uses the power of Puppet to configure the Hadoop cluster. Puppet is a **Ruby DSL**.\r\n\r\n##### Web Apps\r\n\r\nThe cluster exposes three web applications that can help when working with Hadoop and HBase:\r\n\r\n* NameNode - [http://localhost:24200](http://localhost:24200)\r\n* Task Manager - [http://localhost:24201](http://localhost:24201)\r\n* Job History Manager - [http://localhost:24202](http://localhost:24202)\r\n* HBase master - [http://localhost:24203](http://localhost:24203)\r\n \r\n##### Working with the cluster\r\n\r\nIf you actually want to work with the cluster from outside its environment (Eg: run an HBase enabled Java application from your host, connect to Phoenix via JDBC etc.) you will nedd to configure your `hosts` configuration file.\r\n\r\n```\r\n192.168.66.71   zookeeper-1\r\n192.168.66.71   zookeeper-2\r\n192.168.66.71   zookeeper-3\r\n192.168.66.60   master\r\n192.168.66.61   slave-1\r\n192.168.66.62   slave-2\r\n192.168.66.63   slave-3\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n##### What's included\r\n\r\n* Hadoop 2.4.0\r\n* Zookeeper 3.4.6\r\n* HBase 0.98.3\r\n* Phoenix 4.0.0\r\n* Sqoop 1.4.4\r\n* Hive 0.13.1\r\n\r\n##### Feedback\r\n\r\nPlease don't hesistate to provide feedback.\r\n","google":"UA-52245202-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
